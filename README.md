# weaselbot
 
This is a small project made by [Pieter Deconinck](https://github.com/Pieter-Deconinck)

my d&d/savage worlds role playing group has a discord server, where we have a bot that spits out a random excuse that we cant make the session.
I thought it would be cool to have a similar bot but powered with the chatgpt ai for funny prompts. 

it was a good opportunity for me to learn about discord bots and the chatgpt API.
